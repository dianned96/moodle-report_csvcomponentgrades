moodle-report_componentgrades
=============================

Export_csvcomponentgrades is a plugin that exports grades from an assignment for the following grading methods, Rubric and Marking Guide, into a CSV file.

Once installed, as a user who has permission to grade the assignment, navigate to an assignment that uses a Rubric or a Marking Guide grading method. In the Assignment Administration menu, a new menu item will appear: "Export Marking Guide Grades (.csv)" or "Export Rubric Grades (.csv)" as appropriate; click it to download a CSV file containing that assignment's component grades for all students in the course. Note: the download is NOT an Excel spreadsheet. 

In the CSV file, the information exported is both the studentsâ€™ information (first name, last name, username and student ID) together with their respective grades.
